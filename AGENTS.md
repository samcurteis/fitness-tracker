# Fitness Tracker

Personal web app that reads training data from intervals.icu, inspired by IntervalsCompanion.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on samcurteis/fitness-tracker. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: root `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Commands

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Verify (must pass before done): `pnpm verify`
- One test file: `pnpm vitest run src/lib/training-load.test.ts`

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
